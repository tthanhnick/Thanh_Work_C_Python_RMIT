# Thanh_Work_C_Python_RMIT
First of all, this work is related to the computer engineering field, especially in programming (C language).
These files were mainly written in C. Other languages are included like Python.
This is my work as an engineering student at RMIT University Vietnam. Some of my works may contain codes from my studied courses and online sources.
This work contains my teammatesâ€™ contributions as well because some projects/assignments are group-related.
This place is an archive for my learning process at RMIT and I also used it to find a job. 
Although my code may not be original, you should cite and reference my code if you want to use it.
